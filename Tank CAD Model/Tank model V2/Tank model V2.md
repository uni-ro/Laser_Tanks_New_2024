## Advantages
- Using nuts where they are being pulled further into their sockets works very well
![[Nuts being pulled in are good.jpg|500]]

## Issues

- Because the tank tracks are under tension, they are pulling the front track holders and the back track holders together, causing the top plate to bend
![[Top plate bending.jpg|500]]

- The breadboard holder is a little bit too short
![[Badly sized breadboard holder.jpg|500]]

- The motor driver circuit is places as far as possible from the motors. For some reason...

- The tank tracks have a large footprint on the ground which adds a bunch of friction while turning

- The channels the screws holding the back track holders screw into are too thin. They are being bent outwards by the screws
![[Not enough screw clearance.jpg|500]]

- The tank is a little bit too wide. The wheels are popping off

- Nuts appear to be unsuitable for screwing screws into, where the nuts are being pulled out.

Superglue was even used here to secure the nuts in place but it doesnt seem to be enough.

- No propper place to put a battery, battery is secured with cable ties

- No propper place to put the motor driver, the circuit is secured in with cable ties

- There is nowhere for a switch to go
