## Overview
This is the 4th version of the Laser Tank model. It aims to address issues in the V3 model such as
- The screw holes being slightly too small
- The axle holes being slightly too small
- The driver wheel being too close to the idler wheel
- The accidental shallow screw inset holes in the front track holder
- The holder for the switch and two LEDs being too thin
- The corner of the front track holders needing to be clipped to fit properly

A big change made in V4 is the back tracks not being adjustable anymore. Instead, the tracks were modelled and measured. The required length of tracks was found to be roughy 356 mm

## Advantages
- Having the back tracks be at a fixed position improves the visuals of the back of the tank. We no longer have an awkward overhanging area

- Having the back tracks be at a fixed position removes the long thin section of PLA that is prone to bending

- The section that holds the switch and LEDs holds them really firmly and nicely. Giving enough room to connect wires to it

- The section that holds the protoboard holds it really nicely and firmly while being not too difficult to slide in
