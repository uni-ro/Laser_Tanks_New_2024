## Overview
This is the 3rd version of the Laser Tank model.
This version addresses some of the problems realised with V2, namely
- The motor driver circuit being far from the motors
- The channels for the screws for the back tracks being too small
- Nowhere for a switch to go

Version 3 also includes a space for 2 LEDs for showing anything

## Parts
These are the parts needed to build the Tank model V3. It reflects roughly the total cost of building this from scratch.

This table does not include everything. For example the breadboard, and wires and stuff.

## Advantages
- The threaded inserts work very well. If you make the part fit the smaller diameter at the front of the insert and fit the entire length. They are very easy to insert with a soldering iron and will grip on much tighter than a hex nut

- The screw inset depth is perfect to make these rounded M3 screws flush with the top of the body

## Issues
- Holes for the axles to go through are still too small, needing to hammer the axles in
![[Small axles.jpg|500]]
- Holes for the threaded inserts in the front tracks were accidentally too shallow. 
- The driver wheel is too close to the idler wheel next to it. When using tight tracks, they rub against each other causing a lot of friction

- The section for fitting the switch and LEDs is too thin. It broke apart while I was trying to remove the support structure

- The front track holders get too close to the screw holes for the gearbox. The corners need to be cut so that it can fit

- The holes for the screws are a tiny bit too small, the screws don't fall easily through the holes. Not really an issue because the screws can be easily screwed through, but would be nicer if that was not needed
