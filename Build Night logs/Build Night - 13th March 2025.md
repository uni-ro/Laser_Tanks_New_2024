## Progress
- We have been struggling with an issue with the motors on the tank. We are using little DC motors with gears attached to drive the tracks. However, the gear that attaches to one of the motors was not propperly joined to the motor, causing the motor shaft to spin without turning the tracks. We found 2 motors in the club room that have the gears propperly attaches. We swapped out the bad motor for the good one and the tank is now driving like perfect again.
- I (Daniel) have been designing a PCB to replace the protoboard on the current tank. A PCB is going to be way smaller and cleaner than anything I could do on the protoboard. The design is not finished yet, but I will order it ASAP.
- Once the PCB arrives Ill (Daniel) start working on the next version of the tank model. I will design it to propperly hold the PCB in place, probably with screws. 
- Gabriel came up with a concept for a turret
- We are getting really close to the point where we could attach and use a turret. Once wee have the PCB,
